      I’m not just a creator—I’m a curious mind, a storyteller, and someone who
      sees beauty in the details most people overlook. Whether I’m behind a
      camera, designing a UI, or writing a script, my work is driven by one
      question: “What story needs to be told?” With a background in Computer
      Science and Psychology, I blend logic with empathy, design with depth, and
      visuals with voice. My creative journey started in unexpected
      places—editing short videos in my room, capturing forgotten traditions
      like Theyyam, and experimenting with design that feels as intuitive as it
      looks. Over time, what began as curiosity evolved into craft. I'm
      self-taught in tools like DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Figma,
      constantly exploring the intersection of technology, storytelling, and
      emotion. I don’t claim to be a master—but I’m a relentless learner who
      believes growth is the real flex. Outside my creative bubble, I’ve had the
      honor of serving as the President of CAVT and a Student Council Member,
      where leadership became another lens through which I understand people and
      perspectives. In a world full of noise, I aim to create something
      that feels. Whether it’s a documentary that moves you, a design that
      speaks to you, or an idea that makes you pause—I want my work to do more
      than impress. I want it to connect. Welcome to my world. Let’s create
      something meaningful.
