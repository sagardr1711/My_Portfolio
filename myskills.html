    <h3>Digital Marketing Skills</h3>
    <div class="Info-DM">
    <p>
      I have successfully completed the Fundamentals of Digital Marketing course
      by Google, where I gained a solid foundation in core digital marketing
      concepts. Through this program, I developed a clear understanding of how
      digital platforms work and how businesses can grow their online presence.
      I learned the essentials of Search Engine Optimization (SEO)—including
      keyword research, on-page optimization, and improving visibility on search
      engines. I also gained practical knowledge in email marketing, such as
      building subscriber lists, crafting compelling email content, and
      analyzing performance metrics to improve engagement. Additionally, I
      explored the power of social media marketing, learning how to create
      impactful content, engage audiences, and use analytics to track campaign
      success across platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. These
      skills have equipped me to contribute effectively to digital campaigns,
      support brand growth, and make data-driven marketing decisions.

    <h3>Documentary and short video making</h3>
    <div class="Info-SF">
    <p>
      Telling real stories through visual media is where my passion meets
      purpose. I am deeply interested in capturing moments, voices, and themes
      that often go unnoticed—whether it's cultural traditions, social
      realities, or emotional human experiences. My journey into documentary and
      short video making began with a simple curiosity and has evolved into a
      commitment to using film as a tool for storytelling, awareness, and
      connection. I conceptualize and script original ideas, handle the filming
      process, and edit the footage to produce short films and documentaries
      that are both visually and emotionally engaging. While I am still learning
      and growing in this field, I have hands-on experience with DaVinci
      Resolve and Adobe Premiere Pro, and I use these tools to create clean,
      thoughtful edits. My work often includes color grading, sound design,
      voiceovers, subtitles, and music layering to enhance narrative tone and
      flow. One of my favorite themes to explore is culture, such as documenting
      ritualistic art forms like Theyyam, where tradition, spirituality, and
      performance converge in powerful ways. I also enjoy working on videos that
      bring attention to social issues, silent struggles, or overlooked
      perspectives. I believe even short videos have the power to spark thought,
      create empathy, and inspire change. Though I am not a certified
      professional, I approach each project with sincerity, creativity, and a
      desire to improve. Each film I make is a step forward in my learning
      journey—an opportunity to refine my craft and deliver stories that matter.
      My goal is simple: to create meaningful content that leaves an impression.
      Whether it’s a 60-second short or a 10-minute documentary, I strive to
      connect people through storytelling that is raw, relevant, and real.
